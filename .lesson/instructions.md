## Instructions  

Parse the 3 TXs in the TX_.py files by hand!

  ## Steps
    1. Read through the bitcoin_tx_skeleton.py file for some help and to see the parsed transaction python dict structure.
    2. Parse each TX_.py file's raw_hex data into a human readable python dict.
    3. When you're done, replace the "parsed_transaction" dicts with your parsed TXs in the same format.
    4. Hit "Run" above to pretty print the parsed TXs to the console


## ExtraCredit
    1. How do we know the 2nd TX spend was Hal? What ties it to that first TX where Satoshi sent him the 10BTC?
    2. What's special about the 3rd TX? What makes it more private than the first 2 TXs?
